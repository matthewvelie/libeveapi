Most all of the different API Calls require a character ID to be present.  This information is hard for the user to easily be able to determine; while they should know their character name, they will most likely not know the character ID.  This xml file will provide you with the list of the character names, along with their ID's.  At maximum the file will contain three rows of data, as there is a limit of three characters per account.

== Input ==

|| characterID || int || The EVE generated characterID for the specific character on the account you would like to access ||
