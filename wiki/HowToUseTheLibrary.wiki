== General Setup == 
 * Download and extract the library, be sure to keep the .XML file with the .DLL file. This will enable extended intellisense information which makes using the library a whole lot easier.
 * In your application project, add a reference to the .DLL file

== Important ==
* During development you should get your XML responses from a local web server instead of the eve api. [UrlConstants Here's how to set it up].

== Using the Library==
 # Add a using directive at the top of the file
{{{
using libeveapi;
}}}
 # Load the ResponseCache from a file before making any API calls.  This is used when the program shuts down, so all responses will still be cached when the program restarts.
{{{
string responseCacheFilename = "ResponseCache.xml";
if (File.exists(responseCacheFilename ))
{
    ResponseCache.LoadFromFile(responseCacheFilename )
}
}}}
 # Make an API call. If there is a valid (not expired) cached version of the response then that version will be returned automatically. If there is no cached version, or the cached version is no longer valid then a network call to the eve api will be made and the response will be cached.
{{{
CharacterList characterList = EveApi.GetAccountCharacters("userId", "apiKey");
}}}
 # Save the ResponseCache to a file before exiting the application.
{{{
ResponseCache.SaveToFile(responseCacheFilename);
}}}
